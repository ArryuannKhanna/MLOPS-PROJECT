# PyTorch - for building and training the CNN model
torch

# TorchVision - for loading datasets like CIFAR-10 and performing data transformations
torchvision

# Matplotlib - for visualizing training progress
matplotlib

# NumPy - for numerical operations and array manipulations
numpy

# tqdm - for showing progress bars during training (optional but useful)
tqdm

# Pillow - for handling image transformations in TorchVision
Pillow

# PyTest - for running unit tests to validate model performance
pytest

# Docker - (Optional) only if managing the project locally via Docker in the CI/CD pipeline
# If deploying with Docker, Docker should be installed on the host machine, not through Python
# But we list it here for completeness if needed in the local dev setup

# boto3 - (Optional) AWS SDK for Python, required if you're deploying the model to AWS S3
# boto3

# FastAPI - (Optional) for serving the model via an API in deployment
# fastapi

# Uvicorn - (Optional) ASGI server for serving the FastAPI app
# uvicorn
